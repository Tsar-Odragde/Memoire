# **Memoire: A Decentralized AI-Powered Time Capsule**

## **Overview**
Memoire is a decentralized time capsule app that allows users to create AI-generated images from prompts and original images, store them securely, and lock them for a set period. Using cutting-edge decentralized technologies, it ensures that the content remains private and inaccessible until the predefined unlock time.

## **Key Features**
- **AI Image Generation**: Users can input prompts and images to generate new images using state-of-the-art AI models (Stable Diffusion XL, Kandinsky, etc.).
- **Timelock Encryption**: Powered by **Randamu**, ensuring that images remain securely locked until the set release time.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Using **Storacha _and/or_ Akave**, all original and generated images are stored securely with no single point of failure.
- **Decentralized Compute**: The AI inference engine runs on **Lilypad**, leveraging decentralized computation for efficient processing.
- **Secure & Transparent**: No centralized control—users can verify that their data is encrypted and will be accessible only after the specified period.

## **Tech Stack & Integrations**
- **Randamu**: Verifiable randomness for time-based encryption.
- **Storacha/Akave**: Decentralized storage solutions for secure image hosting.
- **Lilypad**: Decentralized compute layer for AI image generation.
- **AI Models**: Exploring **Hugging Face**, **Stable Diffusion XL**, **Stable Diffusion 1.5**, and **Kandinsky** for image generation.
- **Back-End**: API-based architecture to handle storage, encryption, and retrieval.
- **Front-End**: Likely built with **React** for an intuitive user experience.

## **Use Cases**
- **Personal Time Capsules**: Store memories or messages for the future.
- **Creative Storytelling**: Generate AI art locked until a future date.
- **Collaborative Projects**: Teams can create content that remains hidden until a set release date.
- **Future Self Messages**: Send messages or images to your future self with a time delay.

## **Why It Matters**
This project explores the intersection of **AI, encryption, and decentralized technology**, offering users a novel way to create and preserve digital memories with full security and trust. It also showcases the power of decentralized computation and storage, reinforcing the potential of **Filecoin’s ecosystem** in AI applications.
